## Features

- **Flexible Development**: Enables developing decentralized apps using high-level programming languages.
- **Rapid Finality**: Achieves state finalization in under a second.
- **High Throughput**: Supports +100k transactions per second per zApp, and unlimited throughput across the system.
- **Dynamic Security**: Enables dynamic security by specifying the amount of restaked ETH required for running nodes.

## React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh
